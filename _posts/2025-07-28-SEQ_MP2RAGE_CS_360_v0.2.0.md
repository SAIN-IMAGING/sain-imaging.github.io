# SEQ_MP2RAGE_CS_360 v0.2.0: Slab Profile Correction Added

The new version **SEQ_MP2RAGE_CS_360 v0.2.0** introduces a major feature: **slab profile correction**. This update aims to improve the accuracy and quality of MP2RAGE acquisitions, especially for 3D imaging protocols where slab profile effects can impact quantitative results.

## What's New?

- **Slab Profile Correction**: The sequence now includes an option to correct for the non-uniform excitation profile of the slab. This helps to reduce intensity variations and artifacts, leading to more reliable T1 mapping and structural imaging.
- Improved documentation and user interface for easier parameter setup.
- Minor bug fixes and performance improvements.

## Why Slab Profile Correction?

In 3D MRI acquisitions, the slab excitation profile can introduce unwanted intensity modulations across the volume, especially at the slab edges.

 This can affect quantitative measurements and image interpretation. The new correction algorithm compensates for these effects, providing more homogeneous images and robust quantitative results.

## Example Results

Below is an example comparing MP2RAGE / UNI images acquired with and without slab profile correction:

## How to Use

- Update your sequence to v0.2.0. : `] add SEQ_MP2RAGE_CS_360#0.2.0`
- Add the keyword `slab_correction=true` to the reconstruction function
```julia
d = reconstruction_MP2RAGE(path_expno; mean_NR=true, slab_correction = true)
```
